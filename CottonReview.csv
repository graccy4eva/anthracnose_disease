Moreso, there was reportedly a lower resolution for the smaller datasets.

It was reported that the Doublespotted leaf beetle damage easily occurred at the leaf edge with properties of the foreground and background color having an earthen-yellow color which made it difficult to detect on the model. This likely suggest why its accuracy dropped compared to the other diseases."
